1. GateCNN.py is the class of Gate Convolutional Nerual Network model to initialize and propagate during training.
2. RNN_LSTM.py is the class of LSTM model to initialize and propagate during training.
3. TFIDF_Logistic_Regression.py contains the class to load, process and vectorize data by using TFIDF method. Then use Logistic Regression to train model and make predictions. 
4. TextCNN.py is the final approach class of modified Convolutional Nerual Network model to initialize and propagate during training.
5. data_processor.py contains both DataSet classes and functions for processing dataset(s). 
6. main.py take the input data, process the dataset(s), create and tarin the model, perform stochastic gradient descent, predict the test set and generate the final output. 
7. metrics.py includes the function of train, validate, predict, evaluation
